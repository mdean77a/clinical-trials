# Developer Notes

This document is intended for the developers who are working on the Clinical Trial Accelerator project.  Currently that is just me, J. Michael Dean.

I intend this repo to contain a variety of code that will allow experimentation with large language models for clinical trial applications.  So I am really starting over but do not want to get rid of the old code.  So I will create several notebooks in the main directory, and these will utilize code that will be placed in the src directory.

The backend, frontend, and clinical-trial-ui folders are original code that were used in the Demo Project.  I am not disturbing these folders because I may want to reproduce our Demo.  The experimental folder contains the code that I used to mock up the Demo project, and I am also going to not change these files.  However, I will be copying much of this code into the src directory.

I do not understand the purpose of the docker-compose.yml file as we never used it for the Demo Project, but I will keep this file because I think that it may be useful for the future.
